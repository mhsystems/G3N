## Welcome to MultiFlex G3N Public Repositiry

This repository is set up as a primary point for sharing published information with our merchants and channel partners. We strive to be as transparent as possible during our continuous development, enhancement, operations and support processes, ensuring highest level of quality and 100% satisfaction.

This repository provides access to our:

- [Wiki](https://github.com/mhsystems/G3N/wiki) where we provide extensive documentation on various topics related to our G3N offering, including feature lists, plans, documentation, training material and API (public external API for channel partners) documentation, use cases and examples.
- [Issues database](https://github.com/mhsystems/G3N/issues), where we engage with our merchants and channel partners to resolve issues, report on defects; generally a mechanism for holding two way (and transparent) correspondence on individual issues.
